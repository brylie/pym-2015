            <h1>Welcome to Registration for the 2015 PYM Annual Session!</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            We hope you will register before you leave this website! To help encourage you: The theme for this year’s session is FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT: LOVE AND JUSTICE. The themes of love and justice will be intertwined, brought to Light by keynote speaker Lloyd Lee Wilson and presenters Jose Aguto of FCNL and Paula Palmer of Intermountain Yearly Meeting. To be inspired further, read the <a href="http://www.pacificyearlymeeting.org/2015/2015-events/clerks-call/">Clerk’s call to 2015 Pacific Yearly Meeting</a>.

        <h2>Venue</h2>
        <p>
            Walker Creek Ranch is a lovely and rustic nature camp – we expect to be visited by deer, foxes, and other wildlife! The primary areas (Plenary tent and dining hall) are centrally located and the site is relatively flat.
        </p>
        <h3>Phones and Internet</h3>
        <p> There is <span style="font-weight:bold">no cell phone service</span>, but there are pay phones available.</p>
        <p>There is wireless Internet access in some areas of the site.</p>
        <h3>Pets and service animals</h3>
        <p>
            No pets are allowed at Walker Creek Ranch. Trained service animals are allowed.
        </p>
        <h2>Accommodations</h2>
        <p>
            If you are staying on site, you will need to choose either camping or a housing option for each person you register. There are limited semi-private rooms (2 to 5 people per room), some with accessible baths in the same building, but <span style="font-weight:bold">none with private baths</span>. The other housing option is in larger dorm rooms, sharing with 6 to 12 people. Camping is unlimited with many campsites centrally located, and the weather is generally nice. There will be designated dorms for YAF and JYM, or teens may stay with their parent(s) or sponsor(s). Please indicate your choice when you register.
